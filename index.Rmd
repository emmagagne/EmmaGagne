# About

I'm currently a master's student in the Accelerated Master's Program of Biology at the University of Vermont. I will receive my B.Sc. in Biological Science from the University of Vermont in May 2021. I'm originally from Pembroke, New Hampshire. My research focuses on bioacoustics to understand the soundscape of Bocas del Toro, Panama. I look at the impact of anthropogenic boat noise on Bocon Toadfish (*Amphichthys cryptocentrus*) communication, as well as stress from tour boats on Bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops truncatus*) which is reflected in their whistles.

[Manuscript: Boat traffic in Bocas Del Toro, Panama associated with selection for lower and louder toadfish (Amphichthys cryptocentrus) calls.](Final Manuscript - Emma Gagne.pdf)  
**Abstract**: The toadfish is an important acoustic contributor to the local marine soundscape of Bocas del Toro.  Toadfish emit mating calls to attract females to their burrows to spawn. Given that male toadfish calling behavior determines their reproductive success, boat traffic is expected to affect their acoustic behavior. This study evaluates the effects of boat traffic on toadfish call acoustic structure by comparing two sites within the Archipelago of Bocas del Toro, Panama that vary in boat traffic. The study finds the potential presence of three acoustic toadfish species that varied in call contour. One of the acoustic species, called here as ‘flat species’ was found in both study sites. Overall, this ‘flat species’ call was significantly shorter in duration, lower in frequency, and higher in amplitude in the site with high boat traffic than in the site with low boat traffic.  The results suggest that noise associated with boat traffic may be selecting for lower and louder signals in noisy habitats. Given the importance of toadfish as health indicators of marine communities these results are important as they indicate how humans are changing their calls and interactions.
